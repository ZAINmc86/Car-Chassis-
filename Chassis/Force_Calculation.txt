2.2.1. Impulse-Momentum Approach
Formula:

𝐹 = 𝑚×Δ𝑣/Δ𝑡
F= 
Δt
m×Δv
​
 
Where:

F = Average impact force (Newtons, N)

m = Mass of the moving vehicle (kg)

Δv = Change in velocity (m/s)

Δt = Collision duration (s)
Assumptions:

The vehicle comes to a complete stop after impact

𝑣𝑓=0 m/s
𝑣𝑓=0m/s.

Collision is perfectly inelastic (no rebound).
Calculation:

Change in Velocity Δv:

Δ𝑣 =𝑣𝑓−𝑣𝑖=0−27.78=−27.78 m/s
Δ𝑣=𝑣𝑓−𝑣𝑖=0−27.78=−27.78m/s
(Magnitude = 27.78 m/s = 100 km/h)

Assumed Collision Duration Δt:

Δ𝑡=0.1s
(typical for rigid collisions)
Δt=0.1s(typical for rigid collisions)

Calculate Force F:

𝐹=(200 kg × 27.78m/s) / 0.1s =55,560N

Result:

F≈55,560N
